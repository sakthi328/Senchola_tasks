              Formerly known as Madras, Chennai is the capital city of the state
              of Tamil Nadu, in the southern part of India. Located on the
              Coromandel coast of Bay of Bengal, Chennai is as dynamic as it is
              immersed in tradition. This 'capital of the south', is one among
              the four metropolitan siblings of India, having a rich cultural
              history which it perfectly balances with its metropolis lifestyle.
            </p>
            <p className="text-indent text-secondary">
              Amid its chaos of traffic and sweltering humid climate, Chennai is
              worth visiting for its temples steeped in south-Indian culture,
              British-era museums and monuments, culinary delights and Marina
              Beach (Second largest urban beach in the world). Chennai's skyline
              is famous for its towering skyscrapers, but the heart of Chennai
              has an old-world charm to it that refuses to be overshadowed.
